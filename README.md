# 🌾 Rice Disease Detection Classification system
This project focuses on detecting **rice leaf diseases** using **deep learning models**. It leverages pre-trained networks and custom CNNs to classify rice leaf images into four major disease categories, aiding early detection and effective disease management.
## 🚀 Features  
- **Multiple Models for Prediction**  
  - VGG16  
  - ResNet50v2  
  - MobileNetV2  
  - Custom CNNs (RiceNet & RiceClassifier)

- **Interactive GUI** (built with *custom tkinter*)  
  - Upload an image of a rice leaf
  - Select a model (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, RiceNet, RiceClassifier)  
  - Get real-time predictions from different models

## 📊 Dataset
